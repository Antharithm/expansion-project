# Phenomenal Thought: Expansion Project's Sophomore Album

## A New Chapter in Sonic Evolution

Expansion Project's sophomore album, "Phenomenal Thought", marks a significant evolution in the band's musical journey. Released as a follow-up to their debut "Conscious Tortoise", this album showcases the group's versatility and growth, delivering captivating rhythms and enchanting songwriting from start to finish.

&nbsp;

### The Shift in Sound

While "Conscious Tortoise" established Expansion Project's prowess in instrumental funk and jazz fusion, "Phenomenal Thought" ventures into new territory. This album leans more into the alternative and modern rock genres, while still maintaining the groovy, rhythmic essence that defines the band's core sound.

### Lyrical Focus

One of the most striking differences in "Phenomenal Thought" is the presence of lyrics in all ten tracks. Unlike their debut album, which was purely instrumental, this sophomore effort demonstrates Expansion Project's commitment to exploring songwriting in a more traditional sense. This shift allows the band to connect with listeners on a new level, adding depth and narrative to their already impressive musical compositions.
