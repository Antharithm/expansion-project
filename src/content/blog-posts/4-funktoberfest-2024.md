### Headliner Spotlight: The Philharmonik

The event is headlined by The Philharmonik, the winner of NPR's 2024 Tiny Desk Contest. This rising star has been making waves with his hit single "What's it all mean?", a funky tune that delves into life's complexities and societal challenges, all set to an irresistible rhythm.

Christian Gates, known professionally as The Philharmonik, is a multi-talented artist whose musical journey began with classical piano at age 6. His sound, a unique blend of funk, hip-hop, and R&B, is influenced by a wide range of musical legends from Bach to Stevie Wonder, and from Kanye West to Lauryn Hill.

The Philharmonik's latest album, "Kironic", showcases his versatility and depth as an artist, featuring collaborations that highlight his synergistic approach to soul music. His win at the NPR Tiny Desk Contest has catapulted him into the national spotlight, making his appearance at Funktoberfest 2024 a must-see performance.
