# Conscious Tortoise: Expansion Project's Debut Album

## The Birth of a Fusion Powerhouse

In the vibrant music scene of Philadelphia, 2018 marked a significant milestone with the release of Expansion Project's debut album, "Conscious Tortoise". This record not only introduced the world to a fresh sound but also set the stage for what would become one of the most exciting jazz fusion acts in the city.

&nbsp;

### The Band's Origins

Expansion Project's story began in early 2016 when longtime friends Matthew Silva (Keyboards) and Anthony Tilotta (Bass) decided to embark on a new musical journey. Their vision required a drummer with exceptional dynamic playing abilities to complement the diverse genres and styles they were exploring - from funk and jazz to rock and upbeat dance rhythms. Enter Zamere Williams, whose drumming prowess perfectly fit the bill, completing the power trio.

&nbsp;

### The Expansion Project Sound

When asked to describe their genre, the band confidently states: "Jazz Fusion â€“ We stuff jazz and funk into mason jars creating some real thick jams!" This vivid description perfectly encapsulates the rich, layered sound that permeates "Conscious Tortoise".

&nbsp;

### Musical Influences

Expansion Project's sound on "Conscious Tortoise" draws inspiration from a diverse array of contemporary jazz and funk innovators. The intricate rhythms and bold experimentation of Ghost Note, the virtuosic bass work of Evan Marien, and the genre-defying compositions of Snarky Puppy all find their way into the band's musical DNA.

The soulful, electrifying keyboard work of Cory Henry serves as a clear influence on Matthew Silva's playing, while Zamere Williams' dynamic drumming style echoes the innovative approach of Chris Dave. These influences blend seamlessly with the band's own unique vision, resulting in a sound that's both familiar and refreshingly original.

### Recording "Conscious Tortoise"

The creation of "Conscious Tortoise" was a labor of love, representing years of hard work that began long before the band's formation. The album was recorded at the band's own rehearsal studio in North East Philadelphia, showcasing their DIY ethos and intimate knowledge of their sound.

Anthony Tilotta took charge of the preliminary mixing and editing, demonstrating the band's hands-on approach to their craft. The final touch came from Grammy award-winning mastering engineer Phil Nicolo of the renowned Studio 4, adding a professional polish to the band's raw energy.

The recording process revealed an interesting aspect of Expansion Project's creative method. While many of the songs existed in some form before entering the studio, it wasn't until they were worked out in that environment that they truly came alive, evolving into their final album versions.

It's crafted to captivate with a blend of traditional jazz elements and a modern, energetic pulse, offering something new yet familiar to the audience.
