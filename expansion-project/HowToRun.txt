Create .env file
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat node
After you compile & deploy Greeter.sol - paste the contract address in App.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
If Error = ABI is missing.. re-compile, re-deploy and paste that contract address in App.js
npm start to start the program
Switch to the localhost network inside of metamask (hardhat account)
Make sure you are signed into this account: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
Make sure localhost chainID is 31337 or you won't be able to change the blockchain state

View how many tokens for each account - toggle MetaMask accounts and click "Get Balance" on UI

If your commit does not show up remotely:
git checkout anthony
git merge main
git branch -u origin/main anthony
git push origin HEAD
git push origin HEAD:main
git pull from main branch

When sending tokens to another account:
Be logged in to the account that deployed the token contracts
Click 'Get Balance' on the UI to make sure 1M tokens show up
Switch to another account within MetaMask and copy that address
Paste that other address into the 'Account ID' field
Select the amount of tokens you want to send to them
Click 'Send Tokens'

Notes: 
still need to have ethers.js send the token decimal amount in ETH and not in GWEI
getBalance needs to return the correct amount of tokens when checking another account
